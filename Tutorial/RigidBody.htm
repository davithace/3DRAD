            RigidBody is a customizable solid object supporting collision detection and realistic physics simulation.
            <br><br>
            You can use your favorite 3d modeling application to create new rigid-bodies and add them to the RigidBody object library.
            <br><br>
            Your own 3d models are used by the RigidBody object as a reference to implement collision
            detection or determine mass distribution (which ultimately determines
            physics behavior).
            Please see <a href="http://www.3drad.com/importing.htm">this document</a> for details.
            <br><br>
            Run-time, a RigidBody object is usually invisible and its visual aspect is provided by a
            <a href="./SkinMesh.htm">SkinMesh</a> attached to it.
            However, in the Virtual Editor (and run-time, mainly for debug purposes) it is visualized via
            a placeholder-mesh.            
            <br><br>
            The RigidBody can act either as a static object (for example a terrain or the walls in a dungeon) or
            as a dynamic object (a car body, an airplane fuselage, a bullet, a falling rock etc). Please see <em>Total Mass</em>
            parameter (below) for more.
            <br><br>

            <center>
            <font size="3" face="Verdana">
               <strong>FUNCTIONS</strong>
            </font>
            </center>
            <br>
            The RigidBody object will be subject to physics laws as soon as the project is started.
            For example, if it is dynamic and it is linked to a G-Force and a Terrain
            object, it will fall and rebound realistically.
            <br><br>
            After adding a RigidBody object to your project, you can configure it by double-clicking it in the Object List.
            <br>
            <br><br>
            <center>
            <img src="./img/RigidBody_properties.jpg">
            </center>
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Enabled at start</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is not checked, the rigid-body will only perform physics simulation when the
            object is <em>shown</em> by another object, like for example
            <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>.
            <br><br>
            Note that physics is enabled by <em>showing</em> the object, instead of <em>starting</em> it,
            because being <em>enabled</em>, for a RigidBody object, doesn't just mean that its physics
            simulation is performed, but also that its placeholder geometry is rendered run-time.
            But see <em>Display placeholder geometry</em> for more.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Display geometry</strong></center>
            <br>
            Check this option to visualize the rigid-body's placeholder model, run-time.
            Note that the model is not shown if the object is disabled (see <em>Enabled at start</em>).
            <br><br>
            In the Virtual Editor you can only hide the placeholder mesh by right-clicking the item in the Object List.
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Parent bone ID</strong></center>
            <br>
            When this value is non-zero, and the RigidBody object is linked to a SkinMesh which is bone-animated,
            the rigid-body will be attached to the SkinMesh's bone specified by the ID.
            <br><br>
            This feature can be used, for example, to achieve collision-detection and physics for a foot kicking a ball.
            See the example project called SkinMeshBoneRigidBodyDemo.3dr.
            <br><br>
            The bone ID must be a positive, non-zero integer. The first bone in the model is 1, the second 2 and so on.
            What bone corresponds to a certain ID depends on how the animated model was originally designed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> the position of the attached RigidBody object is relative to the bone position when the animated
            model is in its initial pose. This may not be the default pose you see in the Virtual Editor.
            To see the initial pose of all animated SkinMesh objects in the scene, hold the [F] key pressed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> this parameter can be modified run-time by using a script (see 'Internal Parameters' section, below).
            This allows you to detach the RigidBody object (bone ID = 0) or switch target bone.
            Note that this feature is only supported for RigidBody objects that are attached to a bone when the project starts.
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Path</strong></center>
            <br>
            If you <em>attach</em> the RigidBody object to a path by linking it to a
            <a href="./Path.htm">Path</a> object then it will <em>try</em> to follow the pre-defined course.
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Loop Count</strong>.
            This is the number of times the object will loop around the path.
            Non integer values (e.g. 0.5) are supported.</li>
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Speed</strong>.
            Path following speed. When this value is 1, the whole path is completed in one second.
            Negative values are supported (reverse).
            <br><br>
            Note that the relative speed along a specific portion of the path depends on the number of nodes
            defined along the segment. In particular, the more nodes are defined, the slower the speed.
            This property allows you to accurately program speed variations.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Behavior</strong>.
            When the dynamic object is <em>stopped and re-started</em> (for example by an object like
            <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>) it can
            start again from path's beginning, resume from where it was when stopped
            or move the opposite way along the path.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Follow At Start</strong>.
            If this option is not checked, the object will follow the path only when <em>started</em> by
            another object, like for example <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Bone/Path following</strong></center>
            <br>
            When the RigidBody is attached to a bone or a Path, it will <em>tend</em> to follow the bone/path.
            You must tweak the <em>Force intensity</em> and <em>Torque intensity</em>
            factors to achieve an accurate following behavior for your specific object.
            <br><br>
            The remarkable advantage in mixing bone/path following with physics this way
            (instead of using <a href="./SkinMesh.htm">SkinMesh object</a>'s bone/path following functionality for example)
            is that your object can interact realistically with the environment (collisions,
            forces, joints) while traveling along the pre-defined bone/path course.
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Force intensity</strong>.
            The bigger the value, the stronger the attraction force between the bone/path and the object.
            To avoid jittering you should compensate stronger forces by adding some
            <em>Linear damping</em> (see Physics, below).
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Torque intensity</strong>.
            The bigger the value, the stronger the torque used to keep the object aligned with the
            bone (or path direction).
            To avoid wobbling you should compensate stronger toques by adding some
            <em>Angular damping</em> (see Physics, below).
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Physics</strong></center>
            <br>
            <li>
            <strong>Use bounding sphere as body</strong>.
            If this option is checked, the 'solid' volume of your object will be a sphere instead of a detailed physics
            model derived from user-defined geometry (.spg, .coo).
            <br><br>
            This simplified 'solid' volume is faster to process. It is automatically created from the bounding
            sphere of the placeholder mesh and it is recommended over the spg/coo-based version where accuracy for
            collision detection and simulation is not required.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Total Mass</strong>.
            Basically the weight of the object. As a reference, total mass for one liter of
            water (1 kg or 2.2 pounds) is about 1.0.
            <br><br>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> setting masses too low can cause unstable simulations,
            especially when multiple RigidBody objects are connected by using Joint objects to form complex systems.
            Messes below 1.0 are usually not recommended, unless bodies are very simple, like for example single spheres.
            <br><br>
            <font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong></font> Setting
            this value to -1 will make the object static (infinite weight).
            This is typically used for scenery elements, like terrain, buildings, trees and so on.
            <br><br>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> if the RigidBody is box/sphere-group based and its mass is -1, then its position can be set dynamically (run-time),
            for example by using a script (iObject...Set() functions), to achieve paddles and
            similar objects that affect the environment but aren't affected by it.
            For an example please see the demo project called PaddleDemo.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Restitution (between 0 and 1)</strong>.
            The bounciness of the object when colliding with other objects. The smaller the
            factor, the lower the bounciness.
            <br><br>
            Note that when two objects collide, the actual restitution is the average of the restitution
            factors of the two objects.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Friction</strong>.
            Resistance encountered when the object is moved in contact with another object.
            Zero means that there is no resistance. Set a very high value for
            no-slipping friction (max is 3.402823466e+38).
            <br><br>
            Note that when two objects collide, the actual friction is the average of the friction
            factors of the two objects.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Rolling friction (wheel)</strong>.
            You can set lateral and rolling friction independently by enabling this setting.
            When rolling friction is enabled, the <em>Friction</em> factor (above) is used for lateral friction.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Linear Damping (between 0 and 1)</strong>.
            Damping weakens the kinetic energy of the object. The effect on a moving body is similar to
            drag (resistance to motion through a fluid, for example air friction).
            Setting this value to 1 causes zero damping. Zero produces maximum damping.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Angular Damping (between 0 and 1)</strong>.
            Damping can also be applied to rotation. See previous parameter for details.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Max Speed/Spin</strong>.
            These two values let you prevent the RigidBody object from going beyond a certain speed (in meters per second)
            and/or a certain spin (in degrees per second). This is useful to limit the <em>energy</em> involved in collisions.
            <br><br>
            On collisions, excessive speed or spin may cause inaccurate physics simulation, severe frame-rate drops and even crashes.
            To achieve solid simulations, set these parameters to the lowest values allowed by your game design.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Hide/show attached SkinMeshes</strong></center>
            <br>
            This option allows you to hide all SkinMeshes linked to the RigidBody, when the RigidBody object is hidden and show them when the RigidBody is shown. 
            <br><br>
            This feature is typically used with the 'HIDE ON CONTACT' option currently supported by the EventOnContact object, allowing you to
            control visibility of individual RigidBody objects and all their SkinMeshes by using one single EventOnContact object and no scripting.
            <br><br>

            For information about the remaining controls, please <a href="./AllObjects.htm">click here</a>.
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Imposters</strong></center>
            <br>
            This object includes functionality allowing you to create/set/destroy RigidBody object clones run-time by using iObjectImposter*() script functions
            or the <a href="./Imposter.htm">Imposter object</a>. For examples of usage, please see the sample projects named RigidBodyImposters.3dr and
            ImposterObjectRBDemo.3dr (in 3D Rad, press Ctrl+O to visualize the list of available demo projects).
            <br><br>
            The clones (imposters) are identical to the master RigidBody object but perform physics simulation independently. 
            <br><br>
            Collision detection and response is enabled between each imposter and all objects in the scene that are linked (ticked on the Object List)
            to the master RigidBody object. 
            <br><br>
            Collision detection and response are also enabled among the imposter objects themselves (that is, all clones will perform collision detection
            with all other identical clones in the group). 
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, if RigidBody objects are linked (collision enabled), imposters you create for them will perform collision detection (that is,
            collision detection between imposters from different RigidBody objects will be supported). 
            <br><br>
            Because imposters are true internal clones derived from the master data structures (not, recreated by reloading the .spg/.coo files), they
            are fast to create and take advantage of the maximum processing power provided by NVidia PhysX. 
            <br><br>
            NOTE: imposters are supported for both dynamic (box/sphere-group based) and static (polygon-based) RigidBody objects. 
            <br><br>
            NOTE: if the master RigidBody has the 'display geometry' option enabled, its imposters are rendered by using a clone of the
            master's visual. In order to also visualize an imposter's shadows however, the master RigidBody object needs to have one
            defined and the iObjectImposterShadowEnable() script function will have to be called for the imposter. 
            <br><br>
            NOTE: hiding a RigidBody imposter will remove it completely from the simulation. When shown back, physics simulation for it will
            resume at the location where it was when hidden, but without any residual kinetic energy (that is, if an imposter was falling due
            to gravity force, when shown again, it will resume falling from a still state). 
            <br><br>
            NOTE: a new script function called iObjectImposterGet() will also be provided to allow you to retrieve individual imposter positions
            run-time. This will be useful for example to 'attach' imposters from other object types (like SkinMesh, Particles etc) to individual
            RigidBody imposters. 
            <br><br>
            NOTE: physics property changes (like to friction, restitution etc) applied to the master after imposters have been created are not
            automatically transferred to imposters. 
            <br><br>
            NOTE: if the master RigidBody is linked to a G-Force object, the gravity acceleration applied to it will also be applied to all the imposters
            individually as well. Keep in mind however that if the master RigidBody moves out of the area of influence of the G-Force object,
            the accleration will no longer be applied to the imposters, even if they are still within the area of influence of the G-Force object.
            This behavior also dictates that, when gravity is set to radial mode for the G-Force object, the actual acceleration applied to individual
            imposters will be determined by the master position relative to the G-Force object, not the individual imposter object position.
