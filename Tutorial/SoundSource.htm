            A customizable 3d-sound object for your projects.
            <br><br>
            This is basically a sound emitter you can <em>attach</em> to moving objects (for example, a speeding rocket)
            or place somewhere in your 3d environment to implement localized ambient audio effects (for example a
            waterfall, cheering crowd at the finish line etc).
            <br><br>
            The sound source location can be edited in the Virtual Editor.
            <br><br>
            If you link, in the Object List (left of main 3D Rad screen), the SoundSource object to a dynamic object,
            then the relative location of the sound source you set in the Virtual Editor is preserved when the dynamic
            object moves or rotates run-time.
            <br><br>
            This allows you, for example, to <em>attach</em> the engine sound to the rear of a spaceship and the
            laser sound to the front.
            <br><br>
            Optionally, run-time, the frequency can be adjusted dynamically from sound source object's speed,
            to implement effects like car engine sound variations on gear shifting and similar effects.
            <br><br>
            Please see <a href="http://www.3drad.com/add_3d_sound_effects.htm">this tutorial</a> for an example of usage.

            <center><strong>Parameters</strong></center>
            <br>
            <strong>Sound Frequency</strong>.
            The frequency of a sound (Hz) is basically the speed at which it is played.
            <br><br>
            You will have to adjust this value to play each of your own sound files at a proper frequency.
            Note that the maximum frequency playable depends on the installed sound card specifications.
            Frequencies above 100000 (100 kHz), may not be supported on some systems.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Sound Volume</strong>.
            This value is the distance, in meters, beyond which the sound volume starts decreasing.
            <br><br>
            For example, if the value is 5, when the listener (the main camera object) is at 5 meters
            or closer to the sound source, the sound effect volume will be maximum.
            The volume gets progressively lower while the camera moves away from the source, beyond 5 meters.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Looping</strong>.
            If this option is checked, the sound effect is played again and again, indefinitely.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Playing at start</strong>.
            Whether to start playing the sound when the project is run. If this option is unchecked, you will need
            to <em>start</em> this object in order to hear the sound, for example by using the
            <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput object</a>.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Effect</strong></center>
            <br>
            <strong>Bind frequency to speed</strong>.
            If this option is checked, the sound frequency is adjusted dynamically depending on the current sound source object's speed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Speed ranges & Frequency ranges</strong>.
            If the current speed is within one of the ranges specified, then the frequency is adjusted proportionally, within the
            specified frequency range. For example, if the second speed range is 10-20 and its frequency range is 17000-25000
            when the sound object speed is 15 (halfway the speed range), the actual sound frequency will be 29500 (halfway the frequency range).
            <br><br>
            Frequency ranges are in Hz. Speed ranges are in meters per second. One meter per second is 3.6 kilometers-per-hour and 2.2374 miles-per-hour.

            <br>

            Save your sound files to the
            <br><br>
            <font size="2" face="Courier New">
            C:\3D Rad\3DRad_res\objects\SoundSource\Data\
            </font>
            <br><br>
            folder.
            <br><br>
            To assign a sound file to the SoundSource object, open the property dialog for the object, click the
            <em>Change Sound File</em> button and double click the desired file.
            <br><br>
            Supported sound file formats are: .wav, .ogg.
            <br><br>
            IMPORTANT! The sample format must be mono (non-stereo). Any 3d effect for
            the sound is automatically created and managed run-time by 3D Rad.
