            The Projectile object allows you to <em>shoot</em> a series of <a href="./RigidBody.htm">RigidBody</a>
            objects linked to it, one after the other, towards the direction specified by the arrow, at a specified speed.
            <br><br>
            The shooting action is performed as soon as the Projectile object is started by another
            object (like <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>)
            or by a <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a>. 
            <br><br>
            A parameter on the Projectile object's property dialog allows you to set bullet lifetime.
            When a RigidBody bullet has expired (lifetime elapsed) it will disappear
            and will become re-usable (shootable again). 
            <br><br>
            In the Virtual Editor, the Projectile object is an arrow you can orient or <em>attach</em> to
            any moving object, like a Car object (see <em>ProjectileDemo</em> sample project).
            <br><br>
            The arrow can also be attached to animated character bones,
            like the arm of a soldier (see <em>SkinMeshBoneProjectilesDemo</em> sample project). 
            <br><br>
            An internal parameter for the Projectile object contains the object handle of the
            RigidBody bullet that has just been shot and another the handle of the RigidBody that has
            just expired. This allows a script to hide/show/start/stop any object related to the
            bullet when it is shot or when it disappears (see <em>ProjectileObjectInternalParams</em> sample project).

            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Projectile velocity</strong></center>
            <br>
            The speed at which each RigidBody object will be thrown, in meters per second.
            <br><br>
            <font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">Important!</font>
            Very fast RigidBody objects may fail to properly rebound against solid surfaces and go through them,
            due to limits with CPU's finite math calculations.
            A typical workaround is using an <a href="./EventOnContact.htm">EventOnContact</a> object to  hide the bullet
            as soon as a collision is detected for it (see <em>ProjectileHideOnContact.3dr</em> sample project).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Inherit parent inertia</strong></center>
            <br>
            When un-checked, this option prevents the projectiles from being affected by the parent object speed.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Projectile lifetime</strong></center>
            <br>
            Time, in seconds, after which a RigidBody bullet gets re-usable, after it has been shot.
            <br><br>
            If this parameter is zero, bullets will become re-usable as soon as all others have been shot.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: if a projectile is hidden by another object (like <a href="./EventOnContact.htm">EventOnContact</a>)
            it expires, thus becoming re-usable immediately.

            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the Projectile object relates to the objects linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>PROJECTILE. Use this object as a bullet. The object is usually a RigidBody object.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>PARENT. If the Projectile object is linked to another object AND the other object is set
            as PARENT, then it becomes the Projectile object parent. Run-time, when the parent moves
            and rotates, the bullet launcher will follow it, keeping it's relative position as you set
            it in the Virtual Editor. 
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <br><br><br>
            <center><strong>INTERNAL PARAMETERS</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            The following internal parameters can be accessed by using <em>event</em> objects like
            <a href="./EventOnValue.htm">EventOnValue</a> or <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a>:
            <br><br>
            <li>Thrown object. This is the OBJ_ handle of the RigidBody object that has just been shot.
            Please see <a href="./Script.htm">Script object's help file</a> for details on OBJ_ parameters.</li>
            <li>Expired object. The OBJ_ handle of the RigidBody object that has just become re-usable.</li>
