            This object allows you to setup an interactive or A.I. driven walking character
            supporting collision detection with other objects in the scene, including terrain and
            static scenery features.
            <br><br>
            The typical usage requires a spherical RigidBody object, used as basis for character
            physics, and a SkinMesh object, used either as a simple reference for the CamChase
            object or as animated aspect for the character (e.g., an animated humanoid, monster, dinosaur etc).
            <br><br>
            Optionally, the Character object can be linked to one or more <em>target</em> objects,
            typically used as a reference for A.I. algorithms implemented
            by using the Script object.
            <br><br>
            Please see <a href="http://www.3drad.com/character_01.htm">this video tutorial</a> for
            additional information.

            <strong>Mouselook heading sensitivity or rotation speed if target is specified</strong>.
            Mouse-based look-around responsiveness (heading).
            If a target is specified (see Relationships, below) then
            this parameter determines the character's orientation speed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Mouselook pitching sensitivity or target approach damping</strong>.
            Mouse-based look-around responsiveness (pitching).
            If a target is specified (see Relationships, below) then
            this parameter determines the distance at which the character will stop,
            before reaching the target.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Mouselook pitching limits</strong>.
            Mouse-based look-around pitching limits (in degrees).
            <br><br>
            <strong>Walk forward speed, Walk backward speed, Walk sideways speed</strong>.
            These parameters allow you to set movement controls responsiveness.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Run-mode speed ratio</strong>.
            Determines the character speed when in run-mode. For example, setting this value to 2 means that
            the character will move twice as fast as normal mode. Note that values below 1 are permitted, causing
            the character to move slower than normal.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Max. climbable slope (in degrees)</strong>.
            The terrain's gradient angle above which the actor will not be able to climb.
            Make sure that the terrain object (or any other 'climbable' object) is linked to the Character
            and set as 'TERRAIN RIGIDBODY' in the Relationships window (see below), as this parameter
            will be ignored otherwise.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Controls</strong>.
            This group of settings allows you to specify what input devices to use to control the character.
            Note that to change the available default devices and/or let users of your projects to use any
            input device, you must add the <a href="./ConfigureControls.htm">ConfingureControls object</a> to the project.
            <br><br>
            If a control is disabled, its input can be dynamically adjusted by using a script (see below).
            <br><br>
            <strong>Relationships</strong>.
            This list defines how the Character object relates to the objects that are linked to it,
            in the Object List (left side of 3D Rad main screen):
            <br><br>
            <li>SPHERE RIGIDBODY. This object is the spherical RigidBody to use as basis for physics.
                Marking more than one single object this way is not recommended.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>TERRAIN RIGIDBODY. This object is the terrain RigidBody, or another RigidBody-based
                object we want to detect collisions with.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>SKINMESH. This is the SkinMesh object we are using for the character.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>TARGET. This is one of the character's targets. When at least one target is specified, the Character object's
                orientation can no longer be controlled with the mouse. Instead, the Character will always face the closest
                target. This feature can be used as basis for A.I. algorithms implemented by writing a script.</li>
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Network IDs for controls / Player number</strong></center>
            <br>
            In a multiplayer game, when the project is running on the server, Character objects that have controls sets to the same <em>Network ID</em> as
            EventOnInput objects in a project which is running on a connected client PC, will respond based on the remote user input.
            <br><br>
            So, for example, if you have a Character-based game running on the server and the controls of the Character object are associated
            with (have the same Network Id as) EventOnInput objects in a project running on a client, the client PC user will be able to control the
            Character on the server.
            <br><br>
            IMPORTANT: the Character controls you want to be controlled by a remote EventOnInput object must be disabled (un-ckecked) on the Character property dialog.
            Simply setting a network Id for a control will give no results if the control is enabled (checked) on the Character property dialog.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: mouse-look functionality for the Character object is overridden by lef/right controls when left/right controls are remotely controlled.
            Remotely controlled Character objects only respond to input controls supported by the remote EventOnInput objects associated with them.
            <br><br>

            the <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput help file</a> (<em>NETWORK</em> section).

            <br><br><br>
            <center><strong>INTERNAL PARAMETERS</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            The following internal parameters can be accessed by using a <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a> object.
            Note that the corresponding control must be disabled before it can be written run-time.
            <br><br>
            <li>Move Left Input, between 0 and 1, write only</li>
            <li>Move Right Input, between 0 and 1, write only</li>
            <li>Move Forward Input, between 0 and 1, write only</li>
            <li>Move Backward Input, between 0 and 1, write only</li>
