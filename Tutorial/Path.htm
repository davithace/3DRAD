            Use this object to make 3d virtual paths that other objects linked to it can follow.
            <br><br>
            The course is defined by specifying nodes (3d locations) as a list of coordinates.
            The resulting smooth curve which passes through all the points you have defined is automatically
            computed by using a spline algorithm.
            <br><br>
            Path location, orientation and scaling can be edited in the Virtual Editor.
            <br><br>
            The actual path is visualized in real-time while you edit the project.
            <br><br>
            This object can be used to move targets around in a shooter game,
            create reference courses for AI based vehicles and so on.
            <br><br>
            For details on how to use paths with specific objects like for example
            <a href="./SkinMesh.htm">SkinMesh</a> or <a href="./RigidBody.htm">RigidBody</a>
            please see the documentation for those particular objects.

            <center><strong>Working At Start</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is not checked, the path will be ignored (not followed) by objects linked to it.
            It will only operate after it is <em>started</em> by another object,
            like for example <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Recording Mode</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the path will not work as usual, run-time.
            Instead it will record its location at regular intervals, adding the coordinates
            to the list in the Path Nodes box, on the property dialog.
            <br><br>
            This feature allows you to use any moving object in the project to edit a new path.
            For example, you can attach the Path object to a car, set the Path mode to 'recording', launch
            the project and drive the car around to set new path nodes.
            <br><br>
            The <em>Freq</em> parameter defines the frequency at which you want to record the path locations.
            Setting this factor to zero will disable automatic recording. You will still be able to record
            a node by pressing the [R] key though.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Path Nodes</strong></center>
            <br>
            In this window you list the path nodes as a list of coordinates.
            <br><br>
            For each line of text, you must specify the X, Y and Z coordinates of the node, separated by a comma.
            <br><br>
            The values are in meters and they are relative to the current Path object's position.
            <br><br>
            Note that the first node will be the center of the Path object in the editor.
            It means that, if you want the node coordinates to be absolute (world-center-relative),
            Path object orientation must be zero, scaling must be 1 and location must match first node coordinates.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Path visualization line properties</strong></center>
            <br>
            These two parameters allow you to set thickness (in meters) and speed (total time, in seconds,
            to complete a path loop) for the path visualization line.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the Path object relates to the objects linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>PARENT. If the path is linked to an object in the Object List <em>AND</em> the
            object is set as <em>PARENT</em>, then the target object becomes the path's parent.
            Run-time, when the parent moves and rotates, the path will follow it, keeping it's
            relative position as you set it in the Virtual Editor.</li>
