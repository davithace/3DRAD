            The meaning of some properties dialog controls is common to all objects.

            <br>
            <strong>Name</strong>.
            The object's name is shown in the Object List (left side of 3D Rad main screen).
            Because objects are listed in alphabetical order, choosing your objects name properly
            will make project editing easier.
            <br><br>

            <img src="./img/AllObjects_active.jpg">
            </center>
            <br>
            <strong>Active</strong>.
            If not checked, the object is completely ignored run-time and will not be visible.
            Note that inactive objects are normally visible and editable in the Virtual Editor.
            To hide an object in the Virtual editor, right-click on it the Object List.

            <img src="./img/AllObjects_visible.jpg">
            </center>
            <br>
            <strong>Visible At Start</strong>.
            If not checked, the object will not be visible and may not process collision detection (if applicable).
            Run-time, you can show objects that are invisible at start by using event objects like EventTimer.

            <img src="./img/AllObjects_location.jpg">

            <br>
            <strong>Location  X, Y, Z,  in meters</strong>.
            Absolute location of the object, if applicable.
            Object location is either edited visually in the Virtual Editor, or numerically in the
            object's property dialog.
            Note that the natural object's model center is used as a reference, not the current handle location.
            The object's model center is 'hard-coded' in the object file and cannot be changed in 3D Rad.
            In the Virtual Editor, you can move the handle to the model center by right-clicking an object
            while holding [Shift] pressed or by clicking it using the middle mouse button.

            <img src="./img/AllObjects_orientation.jpg">
            </center>
            <br>
            <strong>Orientation about X, Y, Z, in degrees</strong>.
            Absolute orientation of the object, if applicable.
            Editing object orientation visually in the Virtual Editor is easier. Managing 3d orientations
            as angles about XYZ axes instead can be confusing and the dialog controls are only provided
            for completeness.

            <img src="./img/AllObjects_scale.jpg">

            <br>
            <strong>Scaling X, Y, Z (1.0 = original)</strong>.
            Size of the object, if applicable.
            Scaling is relative to the natural size of the model, as defined (hard coded) in the source files.
            It can only be adjusted along object's local axes.
            <br><br>

            <img src="./img/AllObjects_boneid.jpg">
            </center>
            <br>
            <strong>Parent bone ID</strong>.
            When this value is non-zero, and the object supporting this parameter is linked to a SkinMesh which is bone-animated,
            the object will be attached to the SkinMesh's bone indicated by the specified bone ID.
            <br><br>
            This feature can be used, for example, to attach a sword to the hand of a walking character.
            See the example project called SkinMeshBoneDemo.3dr.
            <br><br>
            The bone ID must be a positive, non-zero integer. The first bone in the model is 1, the second 2 and so on.
            What bone corresponds to a certain ID depends on how the animated model was originally designed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> the position of the attached object is relative to the bone position when the animated
            model is in its initial pose. This may not be the default pose you see in the Virtual Editor.
            To see the initial pose of all animated SkinMesh objects in the scene, hold the [F] key pressed.

            <img src="./img/AllObjects_copy.jpg">
            </center>
            <br>
            <strong>Copy, Paste, Save, Load</strong>.
            You can copy object's settings from one object to another (either in the current or another project)
            by using the Copy and Paste buttons or by using [Ctrl]+[C] and [Ctrl]+[V] in the Virtual Editor.
            Object settings can also be saved to and loaded from files.
            Note that some settings may not be ported from/to objects of different type.

            </center>
            <br>
            <strong>OK, Help, Cancel</strong>.
            The Help button opens current object's documentation, if available.
            Click the OK button to confirm the settings or Cancel to close the dialog and ignore any changes.
