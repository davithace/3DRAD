            Add support for any input device to your 3d projects!
            <br><br>
            Keyboard, joysticks, gamepads, steering wheels and any other input device that can be
            installed under Windows® will be available to, and fully configurable by users of your projects.

            Usage is absolutely straightforward. Just add this object to your 3D Rad project and
            double-click it in the Object List to open the configuration dialog.

            <strong>Controls & Descriptions</strong>.
            3D Rad supports up to 32 configurable controls.
            <br><br>
            If you want a control to be configurable run-time by users of your
            project, simply specify a description in the input box next to the control.
            <br><br>
            This description is shown to the user during run-time configuration.
            <br><br>
            You can define the order in which the controls are configured by specifying a priority value
            in the description. For example (see picture above), if you want the <em>Jump</em> control
            to be configured first and <em>Move Forward/Backward</em> last, then type the descriptions as follows:
            <br><br>
            <em>Move Forward @4</em><br>
            <em>Move Backward @5</em><br>
            <em>Turn Left @2</em><br>
            <em>Turn Right @3</em><br>
            <em>Jump @1</em>
            <br><br>
            Priority values must be between @0 and @31. Where no priority is specified, @0 is assumed.
            <br><br>
            Color, size and screen location of the descriptions are definable to adapt
            to the custom background image you can use as GUI.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Text color & opacity</strong>.
            Click the color button to open the color picker.
            Opacity must be between 0.0 (invisible) and 1.0 (fully visible).
            <br><br>
            <strong>Text width & height</strong>.
            Any size is allowed, but values bigger than 2.0 may reduce rendering quality.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Text's screen location</strong>.
            The screen center is at 0,0. Left/right margins are at -16 and 16. Top/bottom margins are at 12 and -12.
            <br><br>
            <center>For information about the remaining controls, please <a href="./AllObjects.htm">click here</a>.</center>
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>RUN-TIME CONFIGURATION</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            If you have specified a description for at least one of the 32 controls (see above), users
            of your project can enter the run-time configuration procedure, by pressing [LeftCtrl]+[LeftShift]+[F9].
            <br><br>
            By default, as GUI, the ConfigureControls object provides simple semi-transparent panels with
            some text. You can customize these as explained below. The default GUI can be rendered as an overlay,
            like in the following example:
            <br><br>
            <center>
            <img src="./img/ConfigureControls_a.jpg">
            </center>
            <br><br>
            If the user chooses to assign the control to a proportional device, the panel changes to the following:
            <br><br>
            <center>
            <img src="./img/ConfigureControls_b.jpg">
            </center>
            <br><br>
            The system can automatically detect any connected input device. If the input is successfully detected it is
            assigned to the current control and the following message appears:
            <br><br>
            <center>
            <img src="./img/ConfigureControls_c.jpg">
            </center>
            <br><br>
            The procedure cycles through all the controls you have made user-configurable.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>CUSTOMIZING DEFAULT CONTROLS</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            Each new 3D Rad project comes with default controls, all assigned to the keyboard.
            <br><br>
            If you want to re-map these default controls for your project:
            <br><br>
            <li>add the ConfigureControls object to a runnable project</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>open the property dialog for it and type a description for the controls you want to re-map and click OK</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>press the [SpaceBar] to launch the project</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>press [LeftCtrl]+[LeftShift]+[F9] to start the run-time configuration procedure</li>
            <br><br>
            The new settings will become the default for your project. If you don't plan to
            make them re-configurable by the final user, you can remove the ConfigureControls
            object from the project.
            <br><br>
            WARNING! Setting the defaults to controls on a device other than the keyboard is not recommended.
            The input controls may not work on systems where the original device is not installed,
            unless the user re-configures them.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>REMARKS</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            In a multi-level compiled project, the ConfigureControls object should only be present in one single level
            (for example the entry-point project, or a game menu),
            if you want the settings to be preserved from one level to another.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>CUSTOMIZING THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            To modify the static background included to the ConfigureControl object, you must replace, in the
            <br><br>
             .\3DRad_res\objects\ConfigureControls\data\
            <br><br>
            folder, the files called
            <br><br>
            controlA.dds<br>
            controlB.dds<br>
            controlC.dds
            <br><br>
            with your own picture files in one of the following formats: .dds, .png, .tga, .jpg, .bmp.
            <br><br>
            While the file extension can change, the file names must be controlA, controlB and controlC.
            For example, valid file names are controlA.jpg, controlB.jpg and controlC.jpg.
            <br><br>
            The 3 files are the first, second and third message shown in the pictures above, respectively.
            <br><br>
            The images will cover the entire screen. If you want them to show some transparency (like the default ones)
            you must use a file format supporting alpha information (.dds, .png or .tga).

            <br><br><br>
