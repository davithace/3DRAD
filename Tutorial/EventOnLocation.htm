            This object starts/stops (or shows/hides) objects linked to it when an object
            enters or exits a definable volume (box).
            <br><br>
            For example, you use this object to play a sound effect or stop a timer
            when a racecar crosses a waypoint.
            <br><br>
            This object can itself be started and stopped by other event objects,
            allowing you to create <em>chains</em> and achieve articulated event management.
            <br><br>
            For more about event objects in general, please see <a href="http://www.3drad.com/event_objects.htm">this tutorial</a>.

               <strong>USAGE</strong>
            </font>
            </center>
            <br>

            Add the EventOnLocation object to your project, link it to all the objects you want to
            monitor for volume crossing and also to all objects you want to start/stop when the
            condition is met.
            <br><br>
            You link objects together in the Object List (left side of 3D Rad main screen), by
            selecting an object and then checking the other objects you want to link to it.
            <br><br>
            The volume is rendered as a cube you can stretch (scale), rotate and place anywhere,
            in the Virtual Editor.
            <br><br>
            To configure the EventOnLocation object, double-click it in the
            Object List to open the following property dialog:
            <br><br>
            <center>
            <img src="./img/EventOnLocation_properties.jpg">
            </center>
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Change Volume Geometry</strong></center>
            <br>
            By default, the volume geometry is a 1 meter wide cube. By clicking this button you can set it to a custom 3d model in DirectX (.x) file format.
            Note that the .x file must be in the
            <br><br>
            <font size="2" face="Courier New">
            C:\3D Rad\3DRad_res\objects\EventOnLocation\Data\
            </font>
            <br><br>
            folder.
            <br><br>
            Note: the higher the number of polygons in the .x file, the slower the processing for the EventOnLocation object.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Display volume</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the volume is also rendered run-time, usually for debug purposes.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the EventOnLocation object relates to the objects that are linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.
            Typically used for linked objects that are <em>starters</em> for this EventOnLocation
            object itself (in a chain of event objects for example).</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>CHECK FOR ENTERING (OFFSET 1/2/3/4/5). Monitor the object to detect when it enters the box.
            <br><br>
            The check is based on a reference point on the object, defined as a
            relative offset from the object's model center.
            <br><br>
            For example, assuming the offset from the model's center is a point on the front bumper of a car,
            this point on the car bumper will still be the reference point when the car moves or rotates.
            <br><br>
            Up to 5 different point locations can be defined (see <em>Object's center offsets</em> section)
            and each monitored object can use one.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>CHECK FOR EXITING (OFFSET 1/2/3/4/5). Monitor the object to detect when it exits the box.
            See <em>CHECK FOR ENTERING</em> above for details.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>START ON CONDITION. Start the object when a crossing condition is detected.
            Note that the target object must provide some 'startable' action.
            See for example the <a href="./SoundEffect.htm">SoundEffect</a> object.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>STOP ON CONDITION. Stop the object when a crossing condition is detected.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>SWITCH ON CONDITION. Switch the object (start if stopped and vice-versa)
            when a crossing condition is detected.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>SHOW ON CONDITION. Show the object when a crossing condition is detected.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>HIDE ON CONDITION. Hide the object when a crossing condition is detected.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>S/H SWITCH ON CONDITION. Switch the object (show if hidden and vice-versa) when a crossing condition is detected.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>RESET. Re-initialize the object completely, to its default state, as defined in the project.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>PARENT. The box will be attached to this object and will move and rotate with it.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>IMPOSTER MASTER. This object (must be a SkinMesh) will be used to visualize EventOnLocation imposters (see <em>Imposters</em> section, below).</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>IMPOSTER MASTER (AUTO). This object (must be a SkinMesh) will be used to visualize EventOnLocation imposters
            (see <em>Imposters</em> section, below). Unlike the similar setting above, this one will automatically remove the
            cloned zone and its imposter SkinMesh when a monitored object enters/exits the cloned zone.</li>
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Execute opposite action on exiting</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the specified action
            is applied to the target on entering the detection zone, and the opposite action is applied to the target on
            exiting the detection zone.
            <br><br>
            This feature can be used, for example, to start a looping sound when an object enters a zone and stop the sound
            when the same object exits the zone.
            <br><br>
            Note that this feature only works for monitored objects that are marked, in the <em>Relationships</em> window, as
            CHECK FOR ENTERING (OFFSET 1/2/3/4/5).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Randomize target object</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the specified action
            is applied to one target object only, picked randomly.
            If the option is not checked, the action is applied to all target objects instead.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Working at start</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is not checked, the EventOnLocation object will not work
            until it is <em>started</em> by using another event object.
            <br><br>
            <center>For information about the remaining controls, please <a href="./AllObjects.htm">click here</a>.</center>

            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Imposters</strong></center>
            <br>
            The EventOnLocation object's detection zone can be 'cloned', run-time. This means that you can create/destroy unlimited detection zones
            run-time, with one single EvenOnLocation object in the project. 
            <br><br>
            Creation/destruction/positioning of zone-clones (also called <em>imposters</em>) can be achieved by using iObjectImposter...() script
            functions or the <a href="./Imposter.htm">Imposter object</a>. 
            <br><br>
            The cloned zones work like the default zone, as an 'extension' of it. That is, the action is triggered when the monitored
            objects enter/exit the main zone or any of its clones. 
            <br><br>
            You can optionally specify a SkinMesh object to visualize where imposter detection areas are created, and also
            optionally remove the detection area imposter (and its SkinMesh, if any) as soon as one of the monitored objects
            enters/exits the imposter area. 
            <br><br>
            For an example of usage of EventOnLocation imposters, please see the demo project called <em>EOLImpostersDemo.3dr</em>.

            <center><strong>INTERNAL PARAMETERS</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            The following internal parameters can be accessed by using <em>event</em> objects like
            <a href="./EventOnValue.htm">EventOnValue</a> or <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a>:

            <li>Condition (1 when entering/exiting condition is detected, zero otherwise). Read only.</li>
