            The Switch object allows you to replace an object with another, run-time, as a consequence of game events.
            <br><br>
            It can also be used to switch between two specified animation sets of a SkinMesh object, with smooth
            transition between the two (animation blending). 
            <br><br>
            The switching is performed once, when the Switch object is <em>started</em> by an event object or a script.
            The Switch object will immediately <em>stop</em> after that.
            <br><br>
            Hiding the Switch object will also hide the two objects (or the animated SkinMesh) linked to it.
            Showing it will only show the item which is currently switched on. 
            <br><br>
            When the Switch object is <em>reset</em>, the <em>primary</em> object is shown (or the primary animation
            set is selected) and the <em>secondary</em> object is hidden.
            <br><br>
            For examples of usage, please see the <em>SwitchObjectDemo</em> and the <em>SwitchAnimSetDemo</em> sample projects.

            <br>
            When checked, the object which is switched on will not be automatically placed to the position of the object
            which is switched off.
            <br><br>
            This setting is recommended when your project manages the position of the object some other way,
            for example when the objects are car-body SkinMeshes attached to a Car.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Do not start/stop objects...</strong></center>
            <br>
            When checked (default) objects linked to the Switch object are simply shown/hidden.
            Otherwise they are also started/stopped when the switching action is performed.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Ignore all settings and...</strong></center>
            <br>
            When two different animation sets are specified, the Switch object will consider the
            <em>primary</em> object as an animated SkinMesh. The switching action will be between
            the two animation sets specified.
            <br><br>
            IMPORTANT! The initial animation set to use will be the one specified in the property dialog
            for the SkinMesh object, not the animation set specified here as <em>primary</em>.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the Switch object relates to the objects linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>PRIMARY. This object will be shown when the project is started.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>SECONDARY. This object will be hidden when the project is started.</li>
            <br><br>
            NOTE: setting multiple objects as <em>primary/secondary</em> is possible
            and useful in some cases, but it's not guarateed to always work as expected.
            For example, all objects will switch to the same location when turned on,
            unless the <em>Do not update position...</em> option is checked.
