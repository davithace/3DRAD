            You can use the Transform object to apply run-time translations, rotations and scaling to the objects linked to it.
            <br><br>
            Transformations are applied once, when the Transform object is <em>started</em> by an event object or a script.
            The Transform object will immediately <em>stop</em> after that.
            <br><br>
            Continuous transformations can be achieved by starting the Transform object at every processing loop. 
            <br><br>
            When the Transform object is <em>reset</em>, all objects linked to it will be set to their initial position.
            <br><br>
            For an example of usage, please see the <em>TransformDemo</em> sample project.
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Translation</strong></center>
            <br>
            These three values are the X, Y, Z increments to add to the linked object's location. The values are in meters.
            <br><br>
            When the Transform object is started, objects linked to it will be translated by the specified amounts
            along the Transform object's local exes (the red/green/blue segments of the object's handle, in the Virtual Editor).
            If the <em>Relative transformations</em> option is un-checked,
            the translations will be along the world axes instead.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Rotation</strong></center>
            <br>
            These three values are the X, Y, Z increments to add to the linked object's orientation. The values are in degrees.
            <br><br>
            When the Transform object is started, objects linked to it will be rotated by the specified amounts
            about the Transform object's local exes. If the <em>Relative transformations</em> option is un-checked,
            the rotations will be world-relative, about the destination object center.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Scale increment</strong></center>
            <br>
            These three values are the X, Y, Z increments to add to the linked object's scaling.
            <br><br>
            When the Transform object is started, objects linked to it will be resized based on the
            new scaling.
            Note that scaling is always target-object-relative, even when the <em>Relative transformations</em> option is checked,

            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the Transform object relates to the objects linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>TRANSFORM. Apply the specified transformations to this object.
                           Note that not all objects support all transformations.
                           Certain objects, like RigidBody and Car, do not support scaling, for example.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>PARENT. If the Transform object is linked to another object AND the other object is set
            as PARENT, then, run-time, when the parent moves
            and rotates, the Transform handle will follow it, keeping it's relative position as you set
            it in the Virtual Editor. 
            </li>

            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Remarks</strong></center>
            <br>
            Please keep in mind that setting the position of a RigidBody object (or any other
            object supporting collision detection, like Terrain, Car etc) causes physics simulation
            to momentarily stop working.
            <br><br>
            If a RigidBody object is moved by using the Transform object
            to a position where it is in contact with another object supporting collision detection,
            the simulation may fail and the collision may not be detected or may cause computation errors and crashes.
