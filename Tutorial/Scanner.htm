            The Scanner object allows you to <em>scan</em> a series of <a href="./RigidBody.htm">RigidBody</a>
            objects linked to it, by using a beam of definable length and size.
            <br><br>
            If the scan intersects one of the target objects, the identifier of the object is exposed as an
            internal parameter of the Scanner object (see below). Contact point distance, absolute 3d location
            and surface normal are also returned.
            <br><br>
            The returned values can be polled run-time by
            a <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a> and actions performed based on them.
            <br><br>
            The scan is performed once, whenever the Scanner object is <em>started</em> by another
            object (like <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>)
            or by a <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a>. 
            <br><br>
            In the Virtual Editor, the Scanner object is displayed as a 3d beam you can orient or <em>attach</em> to
            any moving object, like a Car object (see <em>ScannerDemo</em> sample project).
            <br><br>
            The scanner can also be attached to animated character bones,
            for example a soldier's hand. 
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Scan length</strong></center>
            <br>
            The scanner will only detect objects that are within the specified length (distance from scanner origin, in meters).
            <br><br>
            <font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">Important!</font>
            Because a certain amount of computation is required for each surface traversed by the scan beam, the longer the scan,
            the greater the chances of crossing a very high number of surfaces, thus causing frame-rate loss.
            Scan length should always be the shortest allowed by your project design.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Scan beam size</strong></center>
            <br>
            The ability to specify any size for the scan beam section is what makes this object so powerful.
            Unlike classic single ray scanners, a beam-based scanner allows you, for example, to detect very
            small objects by using just a few or even one single scan. This is important when you use this object,
            as basis for an AI system, where, for example, a character needs to scan the surroundings, looking for
            obstacles and/or targets.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Display scan beam</strong></center>
            <br>
            Check this option to visualize the Scanner object geometry run-time. The geometry is automatically stretched to
            show the actual beam size and length.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the Scanner object relates to the objects linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>TARGET. Include this item among the objects to scan. The object is usually a RigidBody object.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>PARENT. If the Scanner object is linked to another object AND the other object is set
            as PARENT, then it becomes the Scanner object parent. Run-time, when the parent moves
            and rotates, the scanner will follow it, keeping it's relative position as you set
            it in the Virtual Editor. 
            </li>

            <br><br><br>
            <center><strong>INTERNAL PARAMETERS</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            The following internal parameters can be accessed by using <em>event</em> objects like
            <a href="./EventOnValue.htm">EventOnValue</a> or <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a>:
            <br><br>
            <li>Scanned object. This is the OBJ_ handle of the RigidBody object that has just been detected by the scan.
            Please see <a href="./Script.htm">Script object's help file</a> for details on OBJ_ parameters.</li>
            <li>Scan distance. The distance of the contact point, from the scanner origin, in meters.</li>
            <li>Scan location X/Y/Z. Coordinates of the contact point.</li>
            <li>Scan normal X/Y/Z. Components of the surface normal vector, at contact point. The surface is the
            target object surface.</li>
