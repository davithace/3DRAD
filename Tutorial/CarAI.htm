            The CarAI object will drive your vehicles along a pre-defined path,
            trying to avoid collisions with obstacles and other vehicles by applying artificial intelligence algorithms.
            <br><br>
            Optionally, the A.I. alogorithms can be 'reversed' or 'mixed' to achieve different behaviors like
            trying to run into specified targets or drive away from certain objects, either forward or in reverse.
            <br><br>
            To use this object in your project, the first step is setting up all vehicles in the project so that they can be
            driven by using human input controls.
            <br><br>
            This is necessary because the CarAI object, just like a human being, cannot
            drive a car that doesn't provide proper handling.
            <br><br>
            Once you have tweaked your cars, for each vehicle you want to control, just add one CarAI object to your project.
            <br><br>
            Then link it to the car object to control, to the <a href="./Path.htm">Path</a> to
            follow and to all obstacles to avoid.
            Please see <a href="http://www.3drad.com/add_ai_cars_01.htm">this tutorial</a> for details.
            <br><br>
            After you have linked the CarAI object to all these elements, double-click the CarAI object
            in the Object List to open the following property dialog:
            <br><br>
            <center>
            <img src="./img/CarAI_properties.jpg">
            </center>
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Working At Start</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is not checked, artificial intelligence (and the
            controlled vehicle) will only operate after the object is <em>started</em> by another object,
            like for example <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Obstacle dodging</strong></center>
            <br>
            <li>
            <strong>Minimum scanner depth</strong>.
            The distance, in meters, at which an obstacle can be detected depends on controlled vehicle's speed.
            This factor specifies the distance when vehicle speed is zero.
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Max. scanner amplitude</strong>.
            Typically, maximum scanner amplitude should be about vehicle width / 2 (meters).
            The bigger the factor, the higher the chances to detect a small obstacle. However, 
            setting this factor too big may cause the vehicle to react on obstacles that aren't actually on vehicle's path.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Driving carefulness</strong>.
            The bigger the factor, the sooner the vehicle will react to avoid collisions.
            The value must be between 0 and 10.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Max. front deviation angle</strong>.
            This value, in degrees, between 0 and 180, will determine how far from the ideal path the controlled
            vehicle can go to try avoiding a frontal collision.
            <br><br>
            Setting this value too big may cause unsteady driving.
            Setting it to low may prevent the vehicle from avoiding obstacles.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Max. side deviation angle</strong>.
            This value, in degrees, between 0 and 180, will determine how far from the ideal path the controlled
            vehicle can go to try avoiding collisions with other vehicles on its side.
            <br><br>
            Setting this value too big may cause excessive reaction.
            Setting it to low may prevent the vehicle from avoiding contacts.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Deviation return time</strong>.
            Approximate time, in seconds, required to return to the ideal path, after a deviation (see above).
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Enable unblock maneuver</strong>.
            If this option is checked, the controlled vehicle will try to free itself when stuck somewhere.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Path following</strong></center>
            <br>
            <li>
            <strong>Minimum throttle</strong>.
            If this parameter is lower than 1, the vehicle will slow down when turning.
            Minimum value is 0. Maximum value is 1.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Maximum throttle</strong>
            <br>
            You can prevent the controlled vehicle from going full-throttle on straights by setting this factor to any value below 1.
            Minimum value is -1. Maximum value is 1. Use negative values to make the car go reverse.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Brakes</strong>
            <br>
            If this factor is above 0, the controlled vehicle will apply the brakes when an obstacle is detected.
            Minimum value is -1. Maximum value is 1.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Path fuzziness</strong>
            <br>
            If this factor is above 0, the controlled vehicle will follow a slightly different path from
            the one defined in the linked <a href="./Path.htm">Path</a> object.
            The bigger the value, the bigger the alteration. Maximum value is 1.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Randomizer</strong>
            <br>
            If these factors are above 0, the corresponding parameters on the left (<em>Minimum throttle</em>,
            <em>Maximum throttle</em> and <em>Brakes</em>) will be randomized by applying a variation.
            <br><br>
            For example, if you set <em>Maximum throttle</em> to 0.7 and its randomizer value to 0.3,
            when the simulation is started the actual <em>Maximum throttle</em> used will be between 0.4 and 1.0.
            <br><br>
            Note that final value is still capped within its range. So, for example, if you set
            <em>Maximum throttle</em> to 1.0 and its randomizer value to 0.3, resulting value will
            be between 0.7 and 1.0.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>A.I. Mode</strong></center>
            <br>
            <li>
            <strong>Avoid</strong>.
            Follow the path, trying to avoid the obstacles.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Chase</strong>.
            Drive towards the closest target, but try to avoid direct collisions with it.
            Typically, the <em>Brakes</em> parameter in the <em>Path following</em> section is non-zero
            to cause the vahicle to slowdown or stop when close to the target.
            Note that any path is ignored when this AI mode is used.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Target</strong>.
            Try to run into the closest target. Note that any path is ignored when this AI mode is used.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
            <strong>Flee</strong>.
            Drive away from all objects specified as OBSTACLE/TARGET in the <em>Relationships</em> list,
            but also follow the specified path if possible.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the CarAI object relates to the objects linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>DRIVABLE VEHICLE. This object is the vehicle to manage.
            This is typically a <a href="./Car.htm">Car</a>.
            Only one single vehicle can be managed by one CarAI object.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>OBSTACLE/TARGET. This object is an obstacle to avoid.
            This is typically a dynamic <a href="./RigidBody.htm">RigidBody</a> object in the project or
            another vehicle.
            <br><br>
            Do not set the road/terrain object as an obstacle, or your AI vehicle will get really confused!</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>PATH. This object is a <a href="./Path.htm">Path</a> to follow.
            If multiple paths are set this way, one is picked randomly among them, when the simulation starts or,
            run-time, when the CarAI object is reset.</li>
