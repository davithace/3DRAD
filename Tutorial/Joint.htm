            The Joint object allows you to link objects together to make systems as simple as a pendulum or as complex as a ragdoll.
            <br><br>
            Joint's rotational limits can be set and angular forces can be defined to simulate motors and advanced mechanisms.
            <br><br>
            The joint will act on the two objects linked to it, at the Joint object location, which you can set visually, in the Virtual Editor.
            <br><br>
            Joint object orientation is also important as certain joint properties, like rotational limits, motors and axes,
            may depend on it. 
            <br><br>
            Note that the two objects linked to the joint must support physics. RigidBody, Ball, Car, can all be used with joints
            for example, while SkinMesh cannot.
            <br><br>
            Multiple Joint objects can be used to connect multiple RigidBody objects and create any kind of system.
            <br><br>
            When working with joints, keep in mind that the small blue axis of the Joint object item is the local Z axis.
            <br><br>
            When the joint is in a <em>slider</em> mode, the blue axis is the line along which the slider will move,
            with blue axis direction being the positive direction.
            <br><br>
            The blue axis is also the reference for the hinge mode, where it is the axis about which the swiveling happens.
            <br><br>
            Positive rotations are always counterclockwise, if you look at the colored axis, when it points toward your eye.

            <center><strong>Joint Type</strong></center>
            <br>
            A <strong><em>ball</em></strong> joint acts like a single point about which the secondary object can rotate freely,
            unless limits are set (see below).
            <br><br>
            A <strong><em>fixed</em></strong> joint completely glues two objects together, blocking any relative movement.
            Note that fixed Joint position is irrelevant.
            <br><br>
            A <strong><em>fixed (fast)</em></strong> joint is a legacy type, only kept for backwards compatibility. It is now identical to a fixed joint.
            <br><br>
            A <strong><em>hinge</em></strong> joint acts like an axis about which the secondary object can rotate.
            This is always the local Z axis for the Joint object (blue axis).
            <br><br>
            A <strong><em>slider</em></strong> joint acts like a line along which the secondary object can move.
            This is always the local Z axis for the Joint object (blue axis).
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Working At Start</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is not checked, the junction will be enabled only when the Joint
            object is <em>started</em> by another object, like for example
            <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>.
            <br><br>
            In this case, the joint location will be relative to the reference object (see <em>Relationships</em>, below).
            <br><br>
            That is, while the application point for the reference object is the relative
            location you defined in the Virtual Editor, for the second object (body B),
            the application point will depend on object's location at the time of Joint activation.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Angular range (degs)</strong></center>
            <br>
            Where applicable, depending on joint type,
            for each local axis of the Joint object (red arm is +X, green is +Y, blue is +Z) you can define
            the rotational ranges, in degrees.
            <br><br>
            Setting these limits to -180 and +180 actually disables the stop.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: depending on the selected joint type, you may be able to only specify one value for the range.
            In these cases, the range is +/- the value spcified. So, for example, for the Ball joint type, setting
            45 for the angular range about the Y axis will limit the rotation between -45 and 45.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: rotational limits make the simulation more complex to compute and therefore
            may affect frame-rate on slower computers. 
            <br><br>
            NOTE: for <em>slider</em> joints, limits are in meters, from the Joint object location, along its local X axis.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Strength/hardness</strong></center>
            <br>
            These two parameters determine the behavior of the stop (see <em>Angular limits</em>, above).
            <br><br>
            When non-zero, the bigger the <em>strength</em> factor, the stronger the stop.
            A strong stop will resist torques more than a weak stop.
            By default, stop strength is 0 (infinite strength).
            <br><br>
            When non-zero, the bigger the <em>hardness</em> factor, the harder the stop.
            A soft stop will 'absorb' torques in a spongy way.
            By default, stop hardness is 0 (infinite hardness).
            <br><br>
            You can achieve soft stops by setting both strength and hardness
            to low values.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Joint motors</strong></center>
            <br>
            Where applicable, depending on joint type,
            you can apply a torque to the linked objects, about each local axis of the Joint object.
            <br><br>
            The <em>spin</em> factor is the reference angular velocity
            the motor will try to reach and keep, in degrees per second.
            <br><br>
            The <em>torque</em> factor is the angular force applied to reach and keep the specified spin.
            Setting this value to zero disables the motor.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: for <em>slider</em> joints, motor parameters are <em>speed</em> (in meters per second) and <em>force</em>,
            as they are linear quantities.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the Joint object relates to the objects linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>BODY A (REFERENCE). Attach the joint to this object.
            The joint will follow the reference object, keeping its relative orientation and location as you set it in the Virtual Editor.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>BODY B. The second object to attach the joint to. This object will be able to rotate about and move along joint axes,
            based on the joint type and the parameters you specify on the property dialog.</li>
            <br><br>
            NOTE: Specifying more than one single object as body A or more than one single object as body B is not recommended.
            Resulting behavior is undefined.
