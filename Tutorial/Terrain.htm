            Terrain is a set of ready-made maps you can immediately use as basis for your projects.
            <br><br>
            All parts of the terrain model support collision detection and can interact with other
            3D Rad objects like vehicles, characters and so on.

            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Change</strong></center>
            <br>
            Click the <em>Change</em> button to choose a map among the various that are available.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Fast rendering</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, a faster rendering technique is used.
            This will improve frame rate on slower systems, but it may reduce rendering quality.
            <br><br>
            Note that on old systems that do not support hardware processed pixel shaders, this modality is automatically used.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Cast shadows</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the terrain will cast a volumetric shadow.
            This may severely affect frame rate on slower systems.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Receive shadows</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the terrain will receive volumetric shadow from other objects (and itself if <em>Cast shadows</em> above must be checked).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Ignore point lights</strong></center>
            <br>
            By default, if point lights are close enough to affect the Terrain object, the surface is affected by them.
            <br><br>
            However, because rendering surfaces that are illuminated by multiple lights require much more processing power,
            this option allows you to disable this feature to optimize frame-rate.
            <br><br>
            Note that, for each Terrain object, there is a maximum limit of point lights that can affect its surface at any given time.
            Please see the <a href="./PointLight.htm">PointLight object's help file</a> for details.
            <br><br>
            IMPORTANT: point lights with a small range may fail to illuminate terrain surfaces properly, where they are made of big polygons.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Collision detection</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the terrain will detect collision detection with all rigid-body based
            objects linked to it.
            <br><br>
            <br>
            <center><strong>INTERNAL PARAMETERS</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            The following internal parameters can be accessed run-time by using the <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a> object:
            <br><br>
            <li>Internal flags (write-only). This parameter allows you to control visibility in reflections for the Terrain object, as follows:
            set this parameter to 0 to disable 'Visible In Reflections' mode, set it to 1 to enable.</li>
