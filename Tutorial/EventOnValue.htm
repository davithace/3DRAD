            This object starts/stops (or shows/hides) objects linked to it when the numeric parameters
            of a set of monitored objects are within specified ranges.
            <br><br>
            All objects have specific parameters, like <em>life</em> for a character,
            engine <em>power</em> for a car and so on.
            The EventOnValue object can monitor these values and start other objects
            when they are within specific ranges.
            <br><br>
            For example, you use the EventOnValue object to run (start) the ExitFade
            object when Cam1StPerson dies (its energy value is zero). 
            <br><br>
            This object can itself be started and stopped by other event objects,
            allowing you to create <em>chains</em> and achieve articulated event management.
            <br><br>
            For more about event objects in general, please see <a href="http://www.3drad.com/event_objects.htm">this tutorial</a>.

               <strong>USAGE</strong>
            </font>
            </center>
            <br>

            Add the EventOnValue object to your project, link it to all the objects you want to
            monitor and also to all objects you want to start/stop when the conditions are met.
            <br><br>
            You link objects together in the Object List (left side of 3D Rad main screen), by
            selecting an object and then checking the other objects you want to link to it.
            <br><br>
            To configure the EventOnValue object, double-click it in the
            Object List to open the following property dialog:
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the EventOnValue object relates to the objects that are linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.
            Typically used for linked objects that are <em>starters</em> for this EventOnValue
            object itself (in a chain of event objects for example).</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>[parameter] is MONITORED. Monitor the specified internal value of this object.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>START. Start the object when the values of all monitored objects are within the specified range.
            Note that the target object must provide some 'startable' action.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>STOP. Stop the object when the values of all monitored objects are within the specified range.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>SWITCH. Switch the object (start if stopped and vice-versa)
            when the values of all monitored objects are within the specified range.
            Note that, because the checking is performed 75 times per second, a condition-met may be reported several times.
            This causes the target objects to be switched on/off repeatedly.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>SHOW. Show the object when the values of all monitored objects are within the specified range.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>HIDE. Hide the object when the values of all monitored objects are within the specified range.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>S/H SWITCH. Switch the object (show if hidden and vice-versa) when the values of all monitored objects are within the specified range.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>RESET. Re-initialize the object completely, to its default state, as defined in the project.</li>
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Randomize target object</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the specified action
            is applied to one target object only, picked randomly.
            If the option is not checked, the action is applied to all target objects instead.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Value range</strong></center>
            <br>
            The event action is only performed when ALL monitored internal values
            are within the specified range.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Continuous detection</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the range test is performed continuously and the action triggered
            repeatedly (75 times per second), until at least one monitored object's value is no longer
            within the specified range.
            <br><br>
            If this option is not checked, the event action is triggered only once.
            It is performed again only after at least one monitored value changes.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Detect once</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the range test is performed only once.
            Detection is re-enabled only after the EventOnValue object is reset.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Working at start</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is not checked, the EventOnValue object will not work
            until it is <em>started</em> itself by using another event object.
