            The 3D Rad Compiler utility allows you to generate a distributable, stand-alone version of your 3D Rad
            (.3dr) projects.
            <br><br>
            The output can be a standard Windows program (stand-alone executable) or an applet playing in
            a webpage at your website.
            <br><br>
            In either case, the compiled product doesn't require 3D Rad to be installed on the final user's machine. 
            <br><br>
            As a stand-alone executable it can run windowed, maximized or in full-screen at any resolution supported by
            the video-card, including wide-screen formats. Full-screen modes allows for a smoother framerate.
            <br><br>
            When playing in a browser, your projects will still support all the functionality of a regular application,
            including, for example, network gaming, game settings persistence, ability for
            the user to remap game controls and so on.
            <br><br>
            The compiler can combine multiple projects
            into more complex applications where each project can be called by others to
            achieve, for example, multi-level games.
            Please see <a href="./ExitFade.htm">ExitFade object documentation</a> for details.

            <br>
            <center><strong><font size="3">FUNCTIONS</font></strong></center>
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Add Project</strong></center><br>
            Click this button to add a new .3dr project to the list of projects to compile.
            <br><br>
            The project list is on the left of the window. To mark a project
            as the entry point, double click it.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Remove Project</strong></center><br>
            This button removes the currently selected project from the list of projects to compile.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Compiled Project Name</strong></center><br>
            Click in the edit box and specify a name for the compiled executable.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Can run windowed</strong></center><br>
            Check this option to allow users of your stand-alone project to choose whether to run it in windowed mode or full-screen.
            If this option is not checked, they will only be able to select a full-screen display.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: this setting is ignored when the compiled project plays in a browser (embedded into a webpage, see <em>Embed at</em>, below).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Maximized</strong></center><br>
            Check this option to make your stand-alone project run in a borderless, maximized window.
            Unlike full-screen modes, this mode will allow final users to switch between background applications without
            terminating your compiled project.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: this setting is ignored when the compiled project plays in a browser (embedded into a webpage, see <em>Embed at</em>, below).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Adaptive GFX</strong></center><br>
            Check this option to minimize the size of loaded textures when users of your stand-alone project
            select a display size smaller than 640x480 pixels. This will likely reduce rendering quality,
            but it can dramatically improve frame-rate and make your project playable on slower systems.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: this setting is ignored when the compiled project plays in a browser (embedded into a webpage, see <em>Embed at</em>, below).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Compiled Project Icon</strong></center><br>
            Click the <em>Browse</em> button and select an icon (.ico) file to use
            for the compiled executable.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: this setting is ignored when the compiled project plays in a browser (embedded into a webpage, see <em>Embed at</em>, below).
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Global loading image</strong></center><br>
            Click the <em>Browse</em> button and select a .jpg image file to use
            as loading screen for the compiled executable.
            Note that the image will be stretched to fit the screen, if necessary.
            Recommended image size is 1024x768 or bigger.
            <br><br>
            This image will only be displayed while loading projects that don't have their own specific loading image.
            <br><br>
            To associate a loading image with a project, you must save a .jpg file with the same name as the project,
            to the
            <br><br>
            <font size="2" face="Courier New">
            C:\3D Rad\3DRad_res\projects
            </font>
            <br><br>
            folder. For example, a loading image for a project called <em>MyProject.3dr</em> must be named <em>MyProject.jpg</em>.
            <br><br>
            <li>You can also associate a sequence of images to a project, so that they are shown like a slideshow while the project loads,
            by saving the images with their file names numbered.
            For example, <em>MyProject.jpg</em>, <em>MyProject_002.jpg</em>, <em>MyProject_003.jpg</em>, <em>MyProject_004.jpg</em> is a valid
            image sequence. Note that the first image has no number ad that the second image is <em>_002</em>. There is no <em>_001</em> image.
            <br><br>
            When using image sequences, keep in mind that the total number of objects in the project is used as basis to try
            to split the loading time evenly among the images. The actual loading time cannot be used as a reference because
            it cannot be determined before the project is actually loaded.
            <br><br>
            As a consequence, certain images may be displayed for longer than others, based on what kind of objects are loaded
            while they are shown.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>To associate a music loop to a project, so that it is played while the project loads,
            you must save a .wav or .ogg file with the same name as the project,
            to the same folder.
            For example, a loading music loop for a project called <em>MyProject.3dr</em> can be named
            <em>MyProject.wav</em> or <em>MyProject.ogg</em>.</li>
            <br><br>


            <center><strong>Loading progress-bar</strong></center><br>
            Check this option to display a progress-bar while the standalone project loads.
            <br><br>
            The progress bar is shown at the lower edge of the screen, over the loading image (see above).
            <br><br>
            In your compiled projects, you can customize the progress bar aspect by modifying the<br>
            .\3DRad_res\system\progressBar.dds<br>
            file.
            <br><br>
            You can also use a different image format by opening the progressBar.x file with an ASCII editor and changing the
            'progressBar.dds' name to your alternate image file (must be .dds, .png, .tga, .bmp or .jpg).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Include third-party runtimes</strong></center><br>
            Check this option to allow the standalone project to work on Windows®-based systems
            that do not have the latest Microsoft® updates or the latest NVidia® PhysX® system software installed.
            Please see license file for important information.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Embed at</strong></center><br>
            Check this option to compile your project to a browser applet.
            <br><br>
            After compilation (see <em>Compile</em>, below) all you have to do is upload the
            3 generated files to your website.
            <br><br>
            The exact location at your website must be specified in the input box
            before compilation. For example: <em>http://www.3drad.com/</em>
            or <em>http://www.3drad.com/subdir/</em>
            <br><br>
            The URL to launch the compiled applet will be the specified website location
            followed by the uploaded .htm page name (for example <em>http://www.3drad.com/StuntPlane.htm</em>
            or <em>http://www.3drad.com/subdir/StuntPlane.htm</em>).
            <br><br>
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> to the specified website location you must also upload
            the <a href="http://www.3drad.com/OSAKitPro.CAB">OSAKitPro.CAB</a> and
            the <a href="http://www.3drad.com/OSAKitProPlayer.exe">OSAKitProPlayer.exe</a> files.
            <br><br>
            These files are free plug-ins developed by AncientSoft and they must be present on the server
            to allow visitors of your website to play your compiled 3D Rad projects in their browser.
            <br><br>
            A complete SDK and a commercial version of the plug-ins, offering several advantages, including the ability to certify
            the embedded applet by using your own digital signature, is available at the <a href="http://www.osakit.com/">OSAKit website</a>.
            <br><br>
            To all 3D Rad users, Ancientsoft is currently offering a 10% discount (coupon code: 3DRAD10).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Prompt</strong></center><br>
            Check this option to always let visitors of your applet page know and authorize the launch of the OSAKit plug-in,
            when they are on Window XP or Windows Vista with UAC disabled.
            <br><br>
            Enabling this option, which de-activates the OSAKit plugin after every use,
            is <strong>highly recommended</strong> because letting an application run in the browser without
            giving visitors a chance to block it, in case they don't trust the website, isn't a wise security policy.
            <br><br>
            <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: 3D Rad author is not affiliated in any way with AncientSoft and is not responsible
            for any damage caused by the OSAKit plug-in or its use. Use of the OSAKit plugin will be at your own risk.

            <center><strong>Compile</strong></center><br>
            Generates the stand-alone executable (or the browser embeddable files) in a sub-folder within the specified destination folder.
            The sub-folder name will be the compiled project name plus a time-stamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format).
            <br><br>
            For stand-alone executables, the compiled project can be run by
            double-clicking the .exe file in the destination sub-folder.
            To port the compiled project to another PC, simply port the destination sub-folder and its contents.
            <br><br>
            For browser applets, you need to upload the compiled files to your website (see <em>Embed at</em>, above).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>PROTECTING COMPILED CONTENTS</strong></center><br>
            Compiled .3dr files are protected so that they cannot be opened and examined in the editor by the final user.
            <br><br>
            Note that compiling a 3D Rad project only protects the .3dr (project) file.
            It does not protect any resource files (3d models, textures, sounds etc) and the protection applied to the .3dr file is not
            designed to stop serious hacking attempts.
            <br><br>
            In order to fully protect your compiled projects and all the resources you can use third party tools, like
            <a href="https://secure.avangate.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SMARTPAC&AFFILIATE=13851&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartpacker.nl">3D Rad V-Packer</a>,
            specifically developed to protect 3D Rad compiled projects.
