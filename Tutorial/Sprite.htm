            A customizable 2d-graphics object for your projects.
            <br><br>
            You can use the Sprite to add static/animated screen elements to your works, like for example
            a sight in a FPS game, the rotary dial of a speedometer in a racing game, the features
            of the cockpit in a flight simulator, the scrolling background of a 2D game and so on. 
            <br><br>
            You can animate a Sprite by changing its orientation/location run-time with the
            <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a> object. 
            <br><br>
            If the Sprite object is linked to a <a href="./CamChase.htm">camera</a> in the Object List, run-time it will be rendered
            into the viewport for that camera only. This is typically useful when you add
            split-screen functionality to your projects.

            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Work as full-screen mouse pointer</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the sprite will be bound to mouse movements.
            This feature is typically used to implement a custom mouse pointer for compiled projects running in full-screen mode.
            <br><br>
            If the project is not compiled or running in windowed mode, this option disables the sprite object.
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Detect mouse-over event</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is enabled, the Sprite object is checked 60 times per second to see if it is under the mouse.
            <br><br>
            If it is, an internal parameter for the Sprite object is set to 1.
            <br><br>
            Please see the <em>INTERNAL PARAMETERS</em> section below for details.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> the whole original sprite-image is used as a reference.
            Therefore any transparent pixels in the image will raise the mouse-over flag.
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Priority</strong></center>
            <br>
            You can set the general render priority group for the sprite.
            <br><br>
            There are 3 groups currently: render the sprite behind texts, over texts or as a background (i.e. behind
            all 3d objects in the scene except the SkyBox, if present).
            <br><br>
            The value next the drop-down list determines the rendering priority among sprites in the same general priority group.
            This value must be an integer. Negative values are supported.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Rendering mode</strong></center>
            <br>
            Various render modes are supported, including 'burnout', typically used for flares and similar effects.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Base color & opacity</strong></center>
            <br>
            Click the color button to open the color picker.
            Opacity must be between 0.0 (invisible) and 1.0 (fully visible).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Screen location</strong></center>
            <br>
            Screen position of the image center. The screen center is at 0,0.
            Left/right margins are at -16 and 16. Top/bottom margins are at 12 and -12.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: don't forget that you can visually set the sprite location by clicking and dragging the mouse
            in the Virtual Editor window, without opening the property dialog every time.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Width/height</strong></center>
            <br>
            Any size above zero is allowed. To fill the entire screen, set width/height to 32/24 and screen location to 0,0.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: don't forget that you can visually set the sprite size by right-clicking and dragging the mouse
            in the Virtual Editor window, without opening the property dialog every time (you can
            stretch the sprite by right-clicking and dragging while holding the [Ctrl] key pressed).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Rotation angle</strong></center>
            <br>
            Sprite orientation, in degrees.
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Animation</strong></center>
            <br>
            The Sprite object supports frame-based animation as a sequence of images rendered one after the other.
            <br><br>
            The following controls are enabled if a sequence of images is defined for the Sprite, as
            described in the <em>Using image sequences as animated sprites</em> section, below.
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>Initial frame</strong>.
            This value is the initial animation frame. Zero is the first frame, 1 the second and so on.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>Frames per second</strong>.
            This value is the initial animation speed.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>Animation duration</strong>.
            You can set the animation to play for a certain time and then stop. Set this value to zero to play forever.
            This feature can be used, for example, to play an animation only once, by setting the proper
            time, depending on animation speed. Time value is in seconds and decimal values, like 3.731 (3 seconds
            and 731 thousands-of-second) are valid.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>Playing at start</strong>.
            If this option is checked the animation will start playing as soon as the project is started.
            Starting/stopping the Sprite object, for example by using an <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a> object
            or a <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a> object, will start/stop the animation.
            <br><br>
            Note that the animation will re-start from the beginning
            only after the Sprite object is 'reset' by another object or a script. 
            <br><br>

            Save your image files to the

            </font>
            <br><br>
            folder.
            <br><br>
            To assign one image to a sprite, in the property dialog for the sprite, click the
            <em>Change Source Image</em> button and double click the image thumbnail.
            <br><br>
            Note that the image browser will only display a thumbnail of the image if your Windows
            installation supports its format.
            <br><br>
            For example, in order to display a thumbnail for images in .dds format you will likely
            have to install the <em>NVidia DDS Thumbnail Viewer</em> (free) or another similar utility.
            <br><br>
            If you want the sprite to show some per-pixel transparency (like the default one)
            you must use an image file format supporting alpha information (.dds, .png or .tga).
            <br><br>
            Supported image formats are: .dds, .png, .tga, .jpg, .bmp.

            <br>

            The first image of the sequence must be saved to the data folder as described above (<em>USING YOUR OWN IMAGES AS STATIC SPRITES</em>).
            <br><br>
            The remaining images must be saved into a sub-folder of the <em>data</em> folder.
            <br><br>
            The name of the sub-folder must be the same as the initial image file (omitting the extension).
            <br><br>
            The images in the sub-folder must be named by using 4-digit numbers (for example 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg, etc).
            <br><br>
            The extension of the images in the sub-folder must be the same as the initial image (the one saved outside the subfolder).
            <br><br>
            For an example, please see 'animation.jpg' and 'animation' subfolder, in the C:\3D Rad\3DRad_res\objects\Sprite\Data\ folder.
            <br><br>
            To see this animation in action please see the demo project called <em>SpriteAnimation.3dr</em>.

            <center><strong>INTERNAL PARAMETERS</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            The following internal parameters can be accessed by using <em>event</em> objects like
            <a href="./EventOnValue.htm">EventOnValue</a> or <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a>:
            <br><br>
            <li>Red/Green/Blue (base color's RGB components), between 0 and 1</li>
            <li>Opacity, between 0 and 1</li>
            <li>Mouse-over Flag. Run-time, this value is 1 if the mouse is over the Sprite object, 0 otherwise.
                The value is always zero if the <em>Detect mouse-over event</em> option is not checked (see above).</li>
            <li>Animation frame. The animation image to display.</li>
            <li>Frame-rate. Animation speed, in frames per second.</li>
