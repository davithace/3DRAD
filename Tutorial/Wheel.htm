            By attaching this object to any other object supporting physics you can make wheeled vehicles of any sort.
            <br><br>
            Each wheel includes a tweakable motor, a brake, a steering system and a suspension.
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>Working At Start</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is not checked, the wheel will only respond to input controls when the
            object is <em>started</em> by another object, like for example
            <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Throttle, Reverse, Brake and Turn controls</strong></center>
            <br>
            You can make the wheel interactive by checking the box next to one or more input controls.
            <br><br>
            The <em>Delay</em> parameters allow you to set the <em>response time</em> for each control, in seconds (approximately).
            Please note that delays should be set to 0.0 if proportional controls are used (see
            <a href="./ConfigureControls.htm">ConfigureControls</a> for details).
            <br><br>
            Also, keep in mind that input controls must be disabled (unchecked) if you want to control the wheel by manipulating its internal values,
            for example by using a <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a> object.
            See <em>internal values</em> table below for more.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Total Mass</strong></center>
            <br>
            Basically the weight of the wheel. As a reference, total mass for one liter of
            water (1 kg or 2.2 pounds) is about 1.0.
            <br><br>
            Warning! Setting a total mass too small may cause unpredictable behaviors, including
            severe processing slowdown.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Power</strong></center>
            <br>
            The first value is the maximum spin supported by the wheel, in rounds per minute (RPM).
            The second value is the maximum torque provided, considering that it is 100% when
            spin is below 50 rpm. It then goes from 50% to 100% (when rpm is
            70% of maximum allowed) and finally it goes from 100% to 0% (when rpm is maximum allowed).
            <br><br>
            The following torque graph is for a maximum spin of 4000 rpm:
            <br><br>

            </center>
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Reverse power</strong></center>
            <br>
            You can set different spin and torque for when the wheel goes reverse.
            See <em>Throttle</em> above for details.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Brake Power</strong></center>
            <br>
            The bigger the value, the more effective the wheel brake.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Maximum Steering Angle</strong></center>
            <br>
            Maximum turning angle, in degrees.
            Note that the speed at which the wheel turns is determined by the <em>Delay</em> specified for the
            left/right controls, if non-proportional controls are used. See above for details.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Linear Damping (between 0 and 1)</strong></center>
            <br>
            Damping weakens the kinetic energy of the wheel. The effect is similar to
            drag (resistance to motion through a fluid, for example air friction).
            Setting this value to 1 causes zero damping. Zero produces maximum damping.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Angular Damping (between 0 and 1)</strong></center>
            <br>
            Damping can also be applied to rotation. See previous parameter for details.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Suspension Spring</strong></center>
            <br>
            The higher the factor, the stronger the suspension. A strong
            suspension usually means less (smaller) oscillations.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Suspension Damping</strong></center>
            <br>
            The higher the factor, the more absorbing the suspension.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Restitution</strong></center>
            <br>
            The bounciness of the wheel when colliding with other objects. The smaller the
            factor, the lower the bounciness. The value must be between 0 and 1.
            <br><br>
            Note that when two objects collide, the actual restitution is the average of the restitution
            factors of the two objects.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Lateral Friction</strong></center>
            <br>
            Resistance encountered when the wheel is skidding laterally.
            Zero means that there is no resistance. Set a very high value for
            no-slipping friction (max is 3.402823466e+38).
            <br><br>
            Note that when two objects collide, the actual friction depends on factors of both objects.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Rolling Friction</strong></center>
            <br>
            Resistance encountered when the wheel is rolling or applying traction onto the ground.
            See also <em>Lateral Friction</em> for more.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the Wheel object relates to the objects linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>VEHICLE BODY. Attach the wheel to this object.
            The orientation and location defined in the Virtual Editor are kept run-time.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>VEHICLE BODY (COLLISIONS). Same as above, but also perform collision detection
            between the wheel and the vehicle body.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: Specifying more than one single object as vehicle body is not recommended.
            Resulting behavior is undefined.
