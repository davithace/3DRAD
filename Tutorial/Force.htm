            This object allows you to visually apply forces to any 3d object which supports physics,
            like, for example, <a href="./RigidBody.htm">RigidBody</a>.
            <br><br>
            Direction and application point of the force can be set in the Virtual Editor.
            <br><br>
            Intensity of the force can be controlled dynamically by using any object supporting
            internal-value manipulation, like <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a>.
            <br><br>
            To apply a force to an object, simply link it to the Force object and set
            it as the <em>recipient</em> in the Force's property dialog.
            <br><br>
            You link objects together in the Object List (left side of 3D Rad main screen), by
            selecting an object and then checking the other objects you want to link to it.

            <center><strong>Working At Start</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is not checked, the force will be applied only when the Force
            object is <em>started</em> by another object, like for example
            <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Timer</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this parameter is greater than zero, the force will only work for the specified amount of time, in seconds.
            The object can then be re-started by another object, like for example
            <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: run-time, the timer is re-initialized to the specified value whenever the object is started or reset by
            another object.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Intensity</strong></center>
            <br>
            The amount of force to apply.
            <br><br>
            Keep in mind that the resulting movement depends on various factors, including
            recipient object's total mass, mass distribution, application point, damping factors
            and other concurrent forces that may be applied to the same object.
            <br><br>
            <font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana">Important!</font>
            Setting forces too strong may disrupt the simulation and cause relevant loss of performance (bad frame-rate).
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Falloff</strong></center>
            <br>
            If set to <em>distance</em> the intensity of the force will be proportional to target object's distance.
            <br><br>
            If set to <em>1/^distance</em> the intensity of the force will be inversely proportional to the square of target object's distance.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Local orientation</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the direction of the force will follow recipient object rotations,
            basically acting as a booster <em>attached</em> to the recipient object.
            <br><br>
            If not checked, the force will either keep its original global orientation or point towards the target object.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Display vector</strong></center>
            <br>
            Check this option to visualize the force run-time.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Apply as torque</strong></center>
            <br>
            If this option is checked, the force is changed into a torque, that is a rotational force applied
            about an axis passing through the recipient object's center of mass.
            <br><br>
            If no <em>TARGET</em> objects is specified, the rotation axis is defined by the Force object's
            orientation (the yellow arrow in the Virtual Editor). The axis is static if <em>Local orientation</em>
            is unchecked. It rotates with the recipient otherwise.
            <br><br>
            If a <em>TARGET</em> object is specified, the torque is used to orient the recipient object's <em>front side(*)</em>
            towards the target object. The yellow arrow is used as reference rotation axis for this action.
            The axis is static if <em>Local orientation</em> is unchecked. It rotates with the recipient otherwise (not recommended).
            <br><br>
            (*) Recipient object's <em>front side</em> faces the Z+ direction (cursor blue arm) when the object is loaded into 3D Rad's
            virtual space. It depends on how the 3d model was oriented when it was exported from the application used to make it.
            <br><br>
            <center><strong>Relationships</strong></center>
            <br>
            This list defines how the Force object relates to the objects linked to it. 
            The following relationship types are supported:
            <br><br>
            <li>IGNORE. Do nothing.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>RECIPIENT. Apply the force to this object. Specifying more than one single object as recipient is not recommended.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>TARGET. Point the force towards this object. If more than one linked object is specified
            as target, the force will point to the <em>average</em> location.
            <br><br>
            Note that target objects are ignored if the <em>Local orientation</em> option is checked
            and <em>Apply as torque</em> is unchecked.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>INPUT. This object is the input control for the force intensity.
            Basically, the specified object (usually <a href="./EventOnInput.htm">EventOnInput</a>)
            is used to interactively adjust the force.
            <br><br>
            Note that the intensity factor (see above) specifies the maximum amount of force to use
            when the input control is activated (key pressed, joystick pulled, etc)
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <center><strong>INTERNAL PARAMETERS</strong></center>
            <br><br>
            The following internal parameters can be accessed by using <em>event</em> objects like
            <a href="./EventOnValue.htm">EventOnValue</a> or <a href="./Script.htm">Script</a>:
